The fireXrpm scripts are for developers with repo access to generate rpm from
bare checkouts for highly specific purposes X.

They replace (i.e. violate, of necessity) the normal split-responsibility
model of:

1. project release ready to use source tar ball where ./configure is working with no autotools installation needed to build.

1. independent product packager/distribution manager/vendor adds in spec file wisdom/value.

This leads to some Rube Goldbergism, as should be expected.

It is specific to the way we run on certain DOE machines.
You are free to copy it to other names and tune it to your systems.

You may also need to make your own (differently named)
    ./util/release_tarball-300-rhine.sh
replacement, in particular if you want to pull a specific repository branch.

Please note:

Configuration options later in this script affect the source tar ball generated by make dist, so you cannot optimize away the double invocation of configure.
