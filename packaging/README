INTENT

All the packages live in the "ovis-" prefix space, as there are prior
Linux packages for ldms, sos, and possibly others.

This packaging scheme aims to produce relocatable RPMS, in violation of
Redhat/Fedora packaging standards.
Linux dynamic libraries are not normally relocatable once installed, so
to make relocation work the environment MUST specify LD_LIBRARY_PATH at
runtime.

The rpm packaging scripts (.spec.in) files in the source tree may need
adjustments for other platforms, but will work on rhel6.4/centos6.4/toss.


BUILDING ldms 2.2 RPMs (expected to change in future release)

libevent2 must be built and accessible before ldms can be configured.
Because RHEL 6.x does not support libevent2, we install libevent
as part of this rpm build in an LDMS-specific location. 

Packaging is done by:
	- checking out the source tree.
	- ./autogen.sh at the top of the source tree.
	- putting a copy of libevent-2.0.21-stable.tar.gz in the top of the source.
	- running ./packaging/pack-toss.sh from the top of the source.

The result (if all is well and the needed devel packages for ssl, rdma, etc
are installed) will be a set of rpms in centos-* directories at the top of the
source tree. Only ldms-all-2.2.0-ovis1.ch5.1.x86_64.rpm must be installed to
use ldms. The man pages for login and admin nodes are in the corresponding
doc rpm.
