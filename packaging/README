INTENT

All the packages live in the "ovis-" prefix space, as there are prior
Linux packages for ldms, sos, and possibly others.

This packaging scheme aims to produce relocatable RPMS, in violation of
Redhat/Fedora packaging standards.
Linux dynamic libraries are not normally relocatable once installed, so
to make relocation work the environment MUST specify LD_LIBRARY_PATH at
runtime.

The rpm packaging scripts (.spec.in) files in the source tree may need
adjustments for platforms, but will work OOTB on rhel6.4/centos6.4/toss.


BUILDING

libevent2 must be built and installed before the rest can be. We provide
the spec files, but currently you must obtain your own copies of the sources.

Currently building the rpms goes in stages, with installations needed between.
Conceivably, the build stages could be eliminated in one enormous spec file,
and this would eliminate the need for intermediate installations.
The scripts in this directory are all to be run from the top of the
source tree (and check that this is so before doing real work).

A user with sudo privilege can build all the rpms using the build-all.sh script.
This script uses sudo to perform the intermediate rpm installs.
