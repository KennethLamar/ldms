To test,  copy the etc/ layout here into your /etc or imageroot/etc/
and then cd to imageroot (or / if no imageroot) and:

Edit /etc/genders to define the LDMS genders describing the
node roles, data collection network usage, metrics collected, and so forth.

The plan here is to set up a rhel-like set of init scripts for:
	$PREFIX/sbin/ldmsd - the sampler service
	$PREFIX/sbin/ldms-aggd - the aggregation service, a symlink to ldmsd in 1.3

where each (X=ldms-aggd ldmsd) has:
	init.d/X service script
	sysconfig/X service configuration logic using genders data
	sysconfig/X.conf scalar overrides for almost everything.
		
and jointly they use init.d/ldms-functions

We will need corresponding man pages:
	X(5)
	X.conf(5)
	X(8)
