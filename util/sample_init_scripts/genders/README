To test,  copy the etc/ layout here into your /etc or imageroot/etc/
and then cd to imageroot (or / if no imageroot) and:

Clone/Edit /etc/genders.ldms.ataco to define the LDMS genders describing the
node roles, data collection network usage, metrics collected, and so forth.
If desired, ldms genders can be kept together with regular genders in /etc/genders.
This will facilitate starting/stopping data collection with
	pdsh -g ldmsd service ldmsd start

Edit /etc/sysconfig/ldmsd.conf to specify the correct name of the 
genders file for your cluster (same gender file content must be visible from
all nodes) in the LDMS_GENDERS variable.

In /etc/sysconfig/ldms-aggd specify the correct directory location for
STORE_PATH where data will be dumped.

Edit /etc/sysconfig/ldmsd.conf to specify the correct log path
LDMSD_LOG_PATH for your installation. 'syslog' will trigger use of syslog
calls instead of log files. LDMSD_LOG_PATH is also where ldms-aggd will log.
With debug genders other than ldms[agg]d_dbg=ERROR, the log can get a lot of traffic.
