# Generate systemd environment file for ldmsd.
# loaded from systemd ldmsd.service.
# Note that the same physical node can have multiple collection schemes,
# such as chama.few chama.many chama.highfrequency.
# Note that the same physical cluster can have multiple store schemes,
# such as chama.store chama.web chama.splunk.

# Systemd supplied arguments %I /envfilepath
#
# First argument is the cluster/configuration name (no slashes) or local
# Second argument is the output file name.

# Defines Paths to executables and libs and boot functions for samplers.
# This is where the configuration is extracted from genders information.
# Create an alternate genders file and name it in ldmsd.%I.conf for
# exception data, if any, needed.
#
# Correct PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be preset for this to work.
# Paths to invariants are not handled by genders.
#
# Inputs:
# When run on ldmsd@.service instance %I the following shell script is read:
#   $sysconfdir/sysconfig/ldms.d/ldmsd
# See the README in ldms.d for additional details.
#
# Functions defined in $sysconfdir/sysconfig/ldms.d/ldms-functions are
# preloaded.
#
#
# Environment
# Variables exported by ldms.d/ldmsd and its descendants are
# exported to the daemon's environment.
