* Split sampler (ldmsd) from aggregator (ldms-aggd)
* Split common support functions to /etc/init.d/ldms-functions
* Qualified kill statements by $USER, as restarting root daemons should not kill user daemons.
* Moved LDMS_RDMAV_FORK_SAFE to conf file
* tab indent everywhere
* got rid of agg vs node prefix on vars which never meet.
* minimized diff of init.d/ldms*

Init process for each daemon X is:
/etc/init.d/$X
	load stock functions 
	load /etc/sysconfig/$X
then at point of starting, function in init.d/ldms-functions handle
parse /etc/sysconfig/$X.conf which is a generated file for aggs primarily.
