.SH NAME
LDMS_Authentication \- Authentication in LDMS

.SH DESCRIPTION
With LDMS (Lightweight Distributed Metric Service), when compiled with authentication enabled, ldmsd servers require clients
(including
.BR ldms_ls,
.BR ldmsctl,
 and
.BR ldmsd
aggregators) to prove they share a secret with the server. The secret is a text file containing the line
.PP
.RS
       secretword=X
.RE
.PP
where X is a string at least 5 characters long. Lines starting with # in the file are ignored. 
.PP
Three locations are checked in order for the secret before failure is declared:
.RS
.TP
1) the full file path given in environment variable LDMS_AUTH_FILE
.TP
2) $HOME/.ldmsauth.conf
.TP
3) $SYSCONFDIR/ldmsauth.conf (e.g. /etc/ldmsauth.conf)
.RE

where $HOME is taken from
.I /etc/password 
and $SYSCONFDIR is determined at ldms compile time. If the LDMS_AUTH_FILE is not set or does not point to a good secret, the search continues with the next location.
 
To provide security, the secret file permissions should be set so that only the file owner can read it.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
LDMS_AUTH_FILE is a full file path for a secretword file. It is not necessary, if the file is in one of the other checked locations.

.SH BUGS
In this release, ldmsd does not verify that the secret file has permissions 400. Networked file system users should verify the privacy of their secret files.
