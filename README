Quick start guide:

./configure --prefix=/somewhere [options]
make
make install


Options: Given them all here to insure binary consistency across all parts.
Several practical configurations are illustrated in
packaging/make-all-$platform.sh

./configure --help=recursive 
will give the options for all the packages (lib, sos, ldms)

Options from all the packages can be combined and given to as
the options to the top level configure in this directory.

Eventually more configurations will be illustrated in our collection
of nightly testing scripts.
