Quick start guide:

0) Requirements:
libevent2 (not libevent 1.4) must be installed somewhere (it need not be the 
system default). The most recently tested libevent we test with is from 
libevent.org:
	libevent-2.0.21-stable.tar.gz
It is easy to build and install; see README.libevent2.


1) Building:
libevent2_prefix=/opt/ovis
if test -x $libevent2_prefix/lib/libevent_openssl.so; then
  ./configure --prefix=/opt/ovis --with-libevent=$libevent2_prefix [options]
  make
  sudo make install
fi

Options: Given them all here to insure binary consistency across all parts.
	./configure --help=recursive 
will show the options for all the subpackages (lib, sos, ldms).
Several practical configurations are illustrated in
packaging/make-all-$platform.sh


Options from all the packages can be combined and given as the options to 
the top level configure in this directory. The subpackages will ignore unknown options (with warning about them).

Eventually more configurations will be illustrated in our collection
of nightly testing scripts.

2) Running:
