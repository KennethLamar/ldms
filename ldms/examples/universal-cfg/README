This directory contains examples of LDMSD configuration files that define
environment variables and command-line options besides the configuration
commands, e.g., load, prdcr_*, updtr_*, etc.

samplerd-master.conf contains the environment variables, command-line options
and configuration commands to start an LDMSD as a sampler daemon.

agg-master.conf contains the environment variables and command-line options. The
configuration commands, e.g., prdcr_* and updtr_* are defined in
agg-cfg.conf. The 'include' command is used in agg-master.conf to include
agg-cfg.conf.

	- in agg-master.conf, <PATH TO OVIS SRC DIR> must be replaced with the
	  correct path to the OVIS source directory.
