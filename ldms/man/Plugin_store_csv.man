.SH NAME
Plugin_store_csv - man page for the LDMS store_csv plugin

.SH SYNOPSIS
Within ldmsd_controller script:
.br
ldmsd_controller> load name=store_csv
.br
ldmsd_controller> config name=store_csv action=init [ <attr> = <value> ]
.br
ldmsd_controller> config name=store_csv action=custom [ <attr> = <value> ]
.br
ldmsd_controller> strgp_add plugin=store_csv [ <attr> = <value> ]
.br


.SH DESCRIPTION
With LDMS (Lightweight Distributed Metric Service), store plugins for the ldmsd (ldms daemon) are configured via
the ldmsd_controller. The store_csv plugin is a CSV store.
.PP

.SH STORE_CSV INIT CONFIGURATION ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX
The configuration parameters altheader, rolltype, rollover, buffer, and sequence are applied to all metric sets alike.
A subset of these can be overriden by the action=custom values.
.TP
.BR config
name=<plugin_name> action=init path=<path> [ altheader=<0/!0> buffer=<0/!0> rolltype=<rolltype> rollover=<rollover> sequence=<seqname> userdata=<0/!0>]
.br
ldmsd_controller configuration line
.RS
.TP
name=<plugin_name>
.br
This MUST be store_csv.
.TP
action=init
.br
For action=init, the remaining attributes can be specified and will be used for
all metric sets, unless overriden by the action=custom values.
.TP
path=<path>
.br
The output files will be put into a directory whose root is specified by the path argument. This directory must exist; the subdirectories and files will be created. The full path to the output files will be <path>/<container>/<schema>. Container and schema are set when the strgp is added. If you choose a rollover option, then the filename will also be postpended by "-" followed by the epochtime e.g., XXX/meminfo_ctr/meminfo-123456789.
.TP
altheader=<0/!0>
.br
Distinguishes whether or not to write the header to a separate file than the data file. 0 = same file. Any non-zero is a separate file. Default is the same file.
If a separate file is used then, if the data file is called "meminfo" the additional header file will be called "meminfo.HEADER"). If you choose a rollover option, the header file name will be postpended with the epochtime, similar to the data file, and a new one will be written at each rollover. Default is altheader=0.
.TP
userdata=<0/!0>
.br
Distinguishes whether or not to write each metrics' user data along with each data value. 0 = no write. Any non-zero means to write the values. Default is to not write.
.TP
buffer=<0/!0>
.br
Distinguishes whether or not to buffer the data for the writeout. 0 = does not buffer. Any non-zero means buffering occurs. Default is to buffer.
.TP
rolltype=<rolltype>
.br
By default, the store does not rollover and the data is written to a continously open filehandle. Rolltype and rollover are used in conjunction to enable the store to manage rollover, including flushing before rollover. The header will be rewritten when a roll occurs. Valid options are:
.RS
.TP
1
.br
wake approximately every rollover seconds and roll.
.TP
2
.br
wake daily at rollover seconds after midnight (>=0) and roll.
.TP
3
.br
roll after approximately rollover records are written.
.TP
4
roll after approximately rollover bytes are written.
.RE
.TP
rollover=<rollover>
.br
Rollover value controls the frequency of rollover (e.g., number of bytes, number of records, time interval, seconds after midnight). Note that these values are estimates.
.TP
sequence=<seqname>
.br
Controls the ordering of metric data column. This is kept as an option for historical reasons. See STORE COLUMN ORDERING for details.
.RE

.SH STORE_CSV CUSTOM CONFIGURATION ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX
The configuration parameters set by action=init are applied to all metric sets alike,
unless overriden by the action=custom values. Only a subset can be overridden.

.TP
.BR config
name=<plugin_name> action=<custom> container=<container> schema=<schema> [ altheader=<0/!0> sequence=<seqname> userdata=<0/!0>]
.br
ldmsd_controller configuration line
.RS
.TP
name=<plugin_name>
.br
This MUST be store_csv.
.TP
action=custom
.br
This MUST be custom
.TP
altheader=<0/!0>
.br
Overrides the default value set in action = main. Definition is as above.
.TP
container=<container>
.br
The container and the schema together uniquely distinguish the sets that the custom arguments will target
.TP
schema=<schema>
.br
The container and the schema together uniquely distinguish the sets that the custom arguments will target
.TP
userdata=<0/!0>
.br
Overrides the default value set in action = main. Definition is as above.
.TP
sequence=<seqname>
.br
Overrides the default value set in action = main. Definition is as above.
.RE

.SH STRGP_ADD ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX
The strgp_add sets the policies being added. This line determines the output files via
identification of the container and schema.
.TP
.BR strgp_add
plugin=store_csv name=<policy_name> schema=<schema> container=<container>
.br
ldmsd_controller strgp_add line
.br
.RS
.TP
plugin=<plugin_name>
.br
This MUST be store_csv.
.TP
name=<policy_name>
.br
The policy name for this strgp.
.TP
container=<container>
.br
The container and the schema determine where the output files will be written (see path above). They also are used to match any action=custom configuration.node/meminfo.
.TP
schema=<schema>
.br
The container and the schema determine where the output files will be written (see path above). They also are used to match any action=custom configuration.node/meminfo.
You can have multiples of the same sampler, but with different schema (which means they will have different metrics) and they will be stored in different files.
.RE

.SH STORE COLUMN ORDERING

This store generates output columns in a sequence influenced by the sampler data registration. Specifically, the column ordering is
.PP
.RS
Time, Time_usec, ProducerName, <sampled metric >*
.RE
.PP
where each <sampled metric> is either
.PP
.RS
<metric_name>.userdata, <metric_name>.value
.RE
.PP
or if userdata has been opted not to include, just:
.PP
.RS
<metric_name>
.RE
.PP
.PP
The default column sequence of <sampled metrics> is the order in which the metrics are added into the metric set by the sampler (or the order they are specifed by the user).
.QP
Note that the sampler's number and order of metric additions may vary with the kind and number of hardware features enabled on a host at runtime or with the version of kernel. Because of this potential for variation, down-stream tools consuming the CSV files should always determine column names or column number of a specific metric by parsing the header line or .HEADER file.
.PP
Valid sequence options are:
.RS
.TP
forward
.br
List metrics in the order added in the sampler definition or, if metrics are specified by the user, that order.
.TP
reverse
.br
List metrics in the reverse of the order added in the sampler definition (the default for back-compatibility reasons).
.TP
alnum
.br
(reserved) Not implemented. Sort the columns by name and name-embedded numeric values.
.RE

.SH NOTES
.PP
.IP \[bu]
Please note the argument changes from v2.
.IP \[bu]
Note that the default order is FORWARD. This is the inverse of v2.
.IP \[bu]
Note that sequence will be deprecated soon.
.PP

.SH BUGS
No known bugs. In LDMS version 3.x, alnum is not expected to be implemented.
