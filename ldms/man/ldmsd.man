.SH NAME
ldmsd \- Start an ldms daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
ldmsd [OPTION...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The ldmsd command can be used
to start an ldms daemon. Plugin configuration of the ldmsd can be done via the
a configuration file or the ldmsd_controller.

Starting ldmsd with the configuration file option enables you to statically configure a
sampler without requiring python. Dynamically configuring samplers with ldmsd_controller requires python.
Currently, v2's ldmsctl can still be used to dynamically configure a sampler without requiring
python. This capability will be replaced and it is not recommended that you use this option.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.SS
The following environment variables must usually be set:
.TP
LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Path to ovis/lib and libevent2/lib, if not in a system default path. Depending on the system these may be lib64 instead of lib.
.TP
PATH
Include the path to sbin directory containing ldmsd.
.SS The following environment variables may be set to override compiled-in defaults:
.TP
LDMSD_AUTH_FILE
For authentication unless overridden on the command line. Consult ldms_authentication(7) for further details.
.TP
ZAP_LIBPATH
Path to ovis/lib/ovis-ldms
.TP
LDMSD_PLUGIN_LIBPATH
Path to ovis/lib/ovis-ldms
.TP
LDMSD_PIDFILE
Full path name of pidfile overriding the default /var/run/ldmsd.pid unless the command line argument "-r pidfilepath" is present.
.TP
LDMSD_SOCKPATH
Path to the unix domain socket for the ldmsd. Default is created within /var/run. If you must change the default (e.g., not running as root and hence /var/run is not writeable), set this variable (e.g., /tmp/run/ldmsd) or specify "-S socketpath" to ldmsd.
.TP
LDMSD_MEM_SZ
The size of memory reserved for metric sets. Set this variable or specify "-m"
to ldmsd. See the -m option for further details. If both are specified, the -m
option takes precedence over this environment variable.
.TP
LDMS_ENABLE_MMALLOC_DEBUG
If present (any value), enables debugging of set allocations by disabling
mmapped memory management. Not compatible with transports (ugni) that
expect mapped memory.

.SS CRAY Specific Environment variables for ugni transport
LDMS_UGNI_PTAG
For XE/XK, the PTag value as given by apstat -P.
For XC, The value does not matter but the environment variable must be set.
.TP
LDMS_UGNI_COOKIE
For XE/XK, the Cookie value corresponding to the PTag value as given by apstat -P
For XC, the Cookie value (not Cookie2) as given by apstat -P
.TP
LDMS_UGNI_CQ_DEPTH
Optional value for the CQ depth. Default is 2048.
.TP
LDMS_UGNI_STATE_INTERVAL
Optional. If set, then ldmsd will check all nodes' states via rca interface.
States for all nodes are checked and stored at intervals determined by this environment variable. The stored
values are checked against before contacting a node. If you choose to use this option, then the rule of
thumb is to set LDMS_UGNI_STATE_INTERVAL and LDMS_UGNI_STATE_OFFSET such that the node states are checked
before the metric set update occurs (see interval and offset in ldmsd_controller)
.TP
LDMS_UGNI_STATE_OFFSET
Optional. Only relevant if LDMS_UGNI_STATE_INTERVAL is set. Defaults to zero. Offset from zero for
checking the nodes state (see LDMS_UGNI_STATE_INTERVAL, above).


.SH OPTIONS
.SS
General/Configuration Options:
.TP
.BR -F
Run in foreground mode; don't daemonize the program. Default is false.
.TP
.BR -c
The path to configuration file (optional, default: <none>).
.TP
.BI -m " MEMORY_SIZE"
.br
MEMORY_SIZE is the maximum size of pre-allocated memory for metric sets.
The given size must be less than 1 petabytes.
For example, 20M or 20mb are 20 megabytes. The default is adequate for most ldmsd acting in the collector role.
For aggregating ldmsd, a rough estimate of preallocated memory needed is (Number of nodes aggregated) x (Number of metric sets per node) x 4k.
Data sets containing arrays may require more. The estimate can be checked by enabling DEBUG logging and examining the mm_stat bytes_used+holes value at ldmsd exit.
.TP
.BI -r " pid_file"
The path to the pid file for daemon mode.
.TP
.BI -a " secretfile"
Give the location of the secretword file.
Normally, the environment variable LDMSD_AUTH_FILE must be set to the full
path to the file storing the shared secret word

If ldms is configured with --disable-ovis_auth, the -a option disappears and will cause an error if it is given.
.TP
.BR -V
Display LDMS version information and then exit.



.SS
Communication Options:
.TP
.BI -S " SOCKNAME"
.br
SOCKNAME is the unix domain socket name to use for ldmsd_controller access.
.TP
.BI -x " XPRT:PORT"
.br
Specifies the transport type to listen on. May be specified more than once for
multiple transports. The XPRT string is one of 'rdma', 'sock', or 'ugni' (CRAY XE/XK/XC).
A transport specific port number is optionally specified following a ':', e.g. rdma:50000.
.TP
.BI -p " port"
The inet control listener port for receiving configuration. If not specified, no inet port is opened.
.TP
.BI -R " port"
If built with --enable-ldmsd-rctl, the listener port for receiving configuration from the ldmsd_rctl program. If not specified, no rctl port is opened.

.SS
Log Verbosity Options:
.TP
.BI -l " LOGFILE"
.br
LOGFILE is the path to the log file for status messages. Default is stdout unless given.
The syslog facility is used if LOGFILE is exactly "syslog".
Silence can be obtained by specifying /dev/null for the log file or using command line redirection as illustrated below.
.TP
.BI -v " LOG_LEVEL"
.br
LOG_LEVEL can be one of DEBUG, INFO, ERROR, CRITICAL or QUIET.
The default level is ERROR. QUIET produces only user-requested output.
(Note: this has changed from the previous release where q designated no (QUIET) logging).

.SS
Kernel Metric Options:
.TP
.BR -k
Publish kernel metrics.
.TP
.BI -s " SETFILE"
Text file containing kernel metric sets to publish. Default: /proc/sys/kldms/set_list

.SS Thread Options:
.TP
.BI -P " THR_COUNT"
.br
THR_COUNT is the number of event threads to start.
.TP
.BI -f " COUNT"
.br
COUNT is the number of flush threads.
.TP
.BI -D " NUM"
.br
NUM is the number of bytes of the dirty threshold used for store rollover.

.SS Test Options:
.TP
.BI -H " host_name"
.br
The host/producer name for test metric sets
.TP
.BI -i " interval"
.br
Test metric set sample interval
.TP
.BI -t " count"
.br
Create set_count instances of set_name.
.TP
.BI -T " set_name"
.br
Test set prefix
.TP
.BR -N
.br
Notify registered monitors of the test metric sets.

.SS Obsolete options:
.TP
.BI "-q -Z -z"
.br
These v2 options are no longer supported, and will cause exit with a hint.
