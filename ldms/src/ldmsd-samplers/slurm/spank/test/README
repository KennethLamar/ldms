This directory contains files to test run ldmsd:slurm_sampler with
slurm_notifier SPANK plugin.

- plugstack.conf: the SPANK config file for slurmd (also see PlugStackConfig
  option in slurm.conf) that load slurm_notifier SPANK plugin to send job data
  to the ldmsd:slurm_sampler running on the same host.

- ldmsd.sh: the script to run ldmsd with slurm_sampler that receive job data
  from slurm_notifier.

- ldms_ls.sh: a wrapper for `ldms_ls` to conveniently hide the long
  munge authentication options.

- job.sh: the job script


How to use them?

1) edit slurm.conf PlugStackConfig option to point to plugstack.conf. Then,
   restart slurmd.
2) run `./ldmsd.sh` on the node (or nodes) that plugstack.conf has been
   deployed.
3) run a slurm job, e.g.
   - sbatch job.sh # for 1 process
   - sbatch -n 16 job.sh # for 16 processes job
4) `./ldms_ls.sh -x sock -p 10001 -h SOMEHOST -l` to see the job data.
