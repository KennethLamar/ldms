 * \brief OVIS Configuration Management Library.
 *
 * OVIS Configuration Management Library, or libocm, is an implementation of a
 * simple configuration protocol to configure multiple program instances over
 * the network. libocm is event-based and based on libzap. There are
 * configuration provider side and configuration receiver side. They're called
 * the provider and the receiver for short. The provider is the initiator side.
 * Application can add a receiver using function \c ocm_add_receiver(). The
 * provider will then actively connects to the receiver. On the receiver side,
 * the application can register itself to the service with function \c
 * ocm_register(). Then, the application should call \c ocm_enable() to let \c
 * ocm knows that it is ready.  When the receiver and the provider are connected
 * (without application knowing), the receiver side send requests using \c key
 * povided by the application to the provider. The callback function \c
 * (ocm_cb_fn_t) on the provider side will be called with an event that contain
 * request information. The provider side application can use \c key to get or
 * create configuration for this request. The configuration can be build using
 * \c ocm_cfg_buff (with functions \c ocm_cfg_buff_new() , \c
 * ocm_cfg_buff_add_verb() and \c ocm_cfg_buff_add_av()). Then, the application
 * on the provider side can respond the request event with function \c
 * ocm_event_resp_err() or \c ocm_event_resp_cfg().
 *
 * When the connection goes away, the provider will try to reconnect and the
 * same process is repeated.
 *
 * When the provider comes up (e.g. from the crash), it will reconnect and send
 * the configuration to the receivers. In this event, ocm library in the
 * receiver side will automatically drop the configuration that has been
 * received.
